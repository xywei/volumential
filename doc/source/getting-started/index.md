# Getting started

Three pages, in order: provision an environment that produces trustworthy
numbers, evaluate a volume potential, and make sure the computation ran on the
device you intended.

```{toctree}
:maxdepth: 1

installation
first-volume-potential
device-selection
```

Volumential needs a working OpenCL runtime. Everything below assumes one is
installed and that `python -c "import pyopencl"` succeeds; if it does not,
start at {doc}`installation`.

Before running anything, export `PYOPENCL_CTX`:

```bash
export PYOPENCL_CTX=portable:0   # the PoCL platform, device 0
```

Without it, `pyopencl.create_some_context()` — which the examples call — asks
interactively, and in a non-interactive shell that is a run that hangs rather
than one that finishes. {doc}`device-selection` covers the rest; this one line
is enough to get through {doc}`first-volume-potential`.
